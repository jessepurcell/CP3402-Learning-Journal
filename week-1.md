# Estimated Hours

Approx 6 hours between Linkedin videos, Youtube, documentation and learning how to setup the tech stack and deploy to GitHub Pages

# Content Insights

I refreshed my memory on how HTML, CSS and Javascript worked. Laying out the content before applying any styling makes your lofe a lot easier when trying to create an asthetic and functional website design. React and tailwind are fast and easy to use and allow you modularize your website by creating components that can be reused throughout your project which allows you to implement the DRY methodology.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Setting up a modern pipeline for website development allows for rapid development and deployment. GitHub Pages allows for easy website hosting and looks like a good setup for personal projects, portfolios, etc. While I'm not a fan of web development I feel like the information and skills I've learn't and used this week could help me in the future when setting up projects in a professional setting.
